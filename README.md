This is my flooring chatbot I created that utalizes Dialogflow and the cloud app Render. It uses Render to make a webhook that works with Dialogflow to deploy my code. 

All of the code is here in the repo along with sample images of the bot in the zip file.

You can ask the bot anything about flooring and it will pull all of its information from sample_flooring_products.csv
